<!--TODO add template -->
assets:
- used this for Math.random
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random

- got assistance from [Stephen Webber](https://github.com/offgridauthor) for declaring my functions
- [background image and path](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20047364/how-to-give-the-background-image-path-in-css)
- [Make footer fixed and on bottom](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_fixed_footer.asp)
- got assistance from TA for turning objects into constructors
- [Glenn Clark](https://github.com/Elliron/) taught me a helpful trick to get the table to render how I want it (shown below), which I plan to implement at some point. This statement resets and clears the table.

```
nameoftable.innerHTML = '';
```
